## Citing Specific Functionality

Some of the functionality implemented by the P3 Analysis Library
was first introduced in academic papers, as detailed below.

### Performance Portability Metric

The performance portability metric is discussed in the following papers:

- S.J. Pennycook, J.D. Sewall and V.W. Lee, "[A Metric for Performance Portability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07409)", in Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop in Performance Modeling, Benchmarking and Simulation of High Performance Computer Systems (PMBS), 2016
- S.J. Pennycook, J.D. Sewall and V.W. Lee, "[Implications of a Metric for Performance Portability](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2017.08.007)", in Future Generation Computer Systems, Volume 92, March 2019, Pages 947-958
- S.J. Pennycook and J.D. Sewall, "[Revisiting a Metric for Performance Portability](https://doi.org/10.1109/P3HPC54578.2021.00004)", in Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Performance, Portability and Productivity in HPC (P3HPC), 2020

### Code Divergence Metric

The code divergence metric is based on the one proposed in the following paper:

- S.L. Harrell, J. Kitson, et al., "[Effective Performance Portability](https://doi.org/10.1109/P3HPC.2018.00006)", in Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Performance, Portability and Productivity in HPC (P3HPC), 2018

### Cascade Plots

Cascade plots were first introduced in the following paper:

- J.D. Sewall, S.J. Pennycook, D. Jacobsen, T. Deakin and S. McIntosh-Smith, "[Interpreting and Visualizing Performance Portability Metrics](https://doi.org/10.1109/P3HPC51967.2020.00007)", in Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Performance, Portability and Productivity in HPC (P3HPC), 2020

### P3 Analysis Methodology

The end-to-end P3 analysis workflow was first described in the following
article:

- S.J. Pennycook, J.D. Sewall, D. Jacobsen, T. Deakin and S. McIntosh-Smith, "[Navigating Performance Portability](https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSE.2021.3097276)", in Computing in Science & Engineering, Volume: 23, Issue: 5, 01 Sept.-Oct. 2021
