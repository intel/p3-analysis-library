BabelStream Navigation Chart
============================

A navigation chart of BabelStream data.

This example uses real application data collected with the BabelStream
benchmark. However, programming language and platform names have been removed.
The original data is available from https://github.com/UoB-HPC/BabelStream.

Load Data into Pandas
---------------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 18-29

.. code-block:: default


    # import libraries
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import p3


    # Load data from BabelStream results
    df = pd.read_csv(performance_csv)
    df_cov = pd.read_csv(coverage_csv)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-40

Note that, unlike a `cascade plot`_, plotting a navigation chart requires
both performance and coverage data.

Project Labels into Expected Forms
----------------------------------
The :py:func:`p3.data.projection` method can be used to project column names
from the original data into names required by the P3 Analysis Library.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 46-51

.. code-block:: default


    df = p3.data.projection(
        df, problem=["name"], platform=["arch"], application=["language"]
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-65

Our BabelStream data contains only one problem, and the "name" field is
always "BabelStream". Other BabelStream case studies may feature multiple
array sizes, which could also be used here.

The platforms can be identified by the "arch" column, which stores an
architecture name.

For this case study, we treat each implementation of BabelStream as a
different application (consistent with the definition of "application"
here_). Each implementation of BabelStream is identified by the language it
is written in.

Calculate P3 Metrics
--------------------

Application Efficiency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Application efficiency values show which application(s) are most effective
at utilizing a given platform. In the below, any row with an 'app eff' of
0 represents an application that did not run correctly for a given
(problem, platform) combination; any row with an `app eff` of 1 represents
an application achieving the best-known performance.

Code Divergence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Code divergence values show how much code is re-used across the platforms
targeted by a specific application. For BabelStream, only Language 0
has a non-zero divergence, as it is the only implementation containing
different code paths for different platforms.

Performance Portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Performance portability values show the average efficiency achieved when
using all platforms in the set. An application must run across all platforms
to achieve a non-zero performance portability score. For BabelStream,
Language 0 is the only programming model that runs across all 11 platforms.

The plot shows the performance portability and code convergence values for
each implementation of BabelStream. Code convergence is simply (1 -- code
divergence).

The top-right corner of a navigation chart represents the ideal, where an
application achieves the best performance across all platforms of interest
using a single source code. The top-left corner represents an application
that achieves the best performance but without reusing any code across
platforms. Any points along the x-axis are unportable (i.e. there is at least
one platform of interest where it does not run).

For BabelStream, Language 0 is the only implementation that runs across all
platforms and is therefore the only point not on the x-axis. All other
implementations are plotted at (1, 0) because although they use exactly the
same source code to target all platforms, there is at least one platform
where they do not run.
